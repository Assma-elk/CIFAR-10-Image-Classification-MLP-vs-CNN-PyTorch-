# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-MLP-vs-CNN-PyTorch-
This project explores image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using two different neural network architectures: a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The goal is to highlight the limitations of fully connected models on image data and the benefits of convolutional inductive bias.
